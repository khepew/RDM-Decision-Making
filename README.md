# Visual Neuroscience Course Project
- This project explores learning in a perceptual decision-making task.
- A Random Dot Motion (RDM) task is designed using Psychtoolbox, featuring four coherence levels: 3.2, 6.4, 12.8, and 25.6.
- Data is collected from two patients across eight blocks, assessing performance before, during, and after the learning phase.
- Psychometric and chromatic charts are generated from the data.
- Significant changes are analyzed using t-tests.
- Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) parameters, including non-decision time, drift rate, and decision boundary, are fitted and measured throughout all learning phases.
